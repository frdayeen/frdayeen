### Hey there! This is Fazle Rabbi Dayeen!
I am a Doctoral Researcher in Physics.


When it comes to data, I'm your friend! I can analyze it, visualize it, and make it sing with tools like Mathematica, Tableau, Python, and C++. Whether it's physics, condensed matter, or biophysics, I'm comfortable working with complex concepts and unraveling their secrets. So, if you have any big data challenges or just want to geek out about science, hit me up! I'm always excited to connect and learn more.
